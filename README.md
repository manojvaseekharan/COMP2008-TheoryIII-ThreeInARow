==============================
3-In-A-Row is a logic puzzle played on a numbered n×n grid, where n is an even number. Initially, a number of pebbles are laid on the grid, some of them are black, and some of them are white.

The goal of the game is to completely fill the rest of the board with pebbles so that:
• there are never 3 pebbles next to each other, horizontally or vertically, all of the same colour; 
• every row and every column has the same number of black and white pebbles.

The input to the program consists of exactly three lines that should be read from standard input. The first line is the value of n. The second line contains a space separated list of numbers terminated by 0, each number in the list corresponding to a white pebble on the initial board. Similarly, the third line of input contains a space separated list of numbers terminated by 0, where each number represents a black pebble on the initial board.
